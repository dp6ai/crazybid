# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# l = Listing.all

# l.each do |list|
#   puts "Listing.create(:name => '#{list.name}')"
# end

# b = Bid.all 
# b.each do |bid|
#   puts "Bid.create(:name => '#{bid.name}')"
# end
